A MESSAGE FROM THE PRINCIPAL

Dear Gunn Student,
Our vision is to support all Gunn students as they prepare themselves to thrive as global citizens in a rapidly changing
world. We develop our students’ knowledge, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills, and nurture their curiosity,
creativity, and resilience, empowering every child to reach his or her fullest intellectual, social, and creative potential.
Toward that end, our school offers a rich and expansive academic program that requires you to plan and make
decisions based on personal strengths, goals and interests.
The Course Catalog is compiled to help you and your parents with the decision-making process. Here are a few points
that we encourage you to consider during the course selection process:
• Be open. Don’t shy away from taking a class that is outside of your typical academic interest or that you think
you should – you might discover something you love.
• Talk to people (your counselor, teachers, parents, and others who know you well), ask lots of questions and
remember that what you want to study is ultimately your choice.
• Take time to reflect on who you are and who you are trying to become; select classes that will help you develop
new ways of thinking and understanding.
Before making choices read through this book and familiarize yourself with all of the opportunities available. Make
yourself aware of the requirements of the various courses in order to determine how much time and effort you will
need to satisfy these expectations. Again, most importantly, don’t be afraid to ask questions and/or ask for help
throughout this process. We are here for you.
If you are considering taking multiple honors and/or Advanced Placement courses, we expect you to be thoughtful
when you fill out the Time Management form, and we hope you recognize that sleep is a non-negotiable of nine
hours/night. Not six hours per night... nine hours each night! Because we value your wellness, we encourage you to
take no more than two AP courses per year. Taking on more often results in less sleep and the research is clear – your
brain needs to recharge every night while you sleep. Please take good care of yourself in this regard.
Finally, please know we want you to choose a healthy, balanced life. We encourage you to design a program of study
that is personally challenging, requires you to stretch and grow and brings you joy. Choose courses that will allow you
to balance your academic priorities with the rest of your in and out of school responsibilities. We hope you select
courses that will leave you with enough time to develop the necessary skills to become resilient, ethical, and motivated
learners and that honors your individual interests, strengths and talents. Most importantly, we want you to enjoy your
high school years, learn to love learning and have fun! This is a great time to be a Titan!

THE PROMISE

"Building upon a foundation of excellence."
Dr. Don Austin

SERVE AND CELEBRATE OTHERS
The staff and students of PAUSD will become a community of "builders" through investing in
service and celebrations on behalf of others. We will positively impact peers, colleagues, and
the broader community through human interaction and connections free of judgment and
full of joy. Programs, groups, and individuals will be routinely celebrated for building people
up through their actions, words, and kindness. Our shared commitment to celebrating our
builders will allow for multiple layers of people to contribute at every level.
MENTAL HEALTH AND WELLNESS
We strive to provide social, emotional, and physical health needs of all students. Our goal is to
cultivate positive, identity-safe school environments that promote high levels of connection,
engagement and overall well-being throughout the school community.

EARLY LITERACY

Every Student Reads Initiative (ESRI) strives to reach the goal of ALL students reading at
grade level by the end of third grade. Resources align with an "all in" approach to address
early literacy. Students who enter the fourth grade at or above level are best prepared for
future success. All students reading competently by fourth grade will change the trajectory of
many students.
EQUITY AND EXCELLENCE
Excellence shall become the norm for all regardless of background or demographics. Our
schools shall embrace uniqueness, strengths, and challenges with support, understanding,
expectations, and encouragement to succeed.

HEALTHY ATTENDANCE
Healthy Attendance is a way of clarifying we want everyone to attend when they are healthy
and able to be with us safely.

COURSE SELECTION OVERVIEW
We are committed to using course enrollment practices that increase access to increased rigor, including to honors
and AP courses for historically underrepresented students. All students will have the right to participate in our
honors and Advanced Placement Program, as long as prerequisite coursework is successfully completed.
Our definition of successful completion of a course is aligned with the University of California System definition that
a student must earn a C- or higher to demonstrate minimal proficiency.
The school master schedule is built in the spring based upon student needs and student course requests. The schedule
is constructed so that students are enrolled in courses they must have, and every effort is made to schedule the electives
they would like to have. The schedule also takes into account the staff and facility parameters that affect the schedule.
Courses and schools are staffed based on student course selection in the spring. Once course sections are finalized,
changes will be made only within extenuating circumstances based on approval from the Assistant Principal of Student
Services. Therefore, every student should regard the schedule they receive as a contract. The school has provided the
courses, and the student has the obligation to attend and participate in those courses.
All students must be enrolled in a minimum of five (5) courses to be considered full-time students. Students will not
be permitted to drop a course if this puts them below the minimum required course/credit load.
Student Grade Level

Recommended Number of Courses per Semester

those subject areas.

2.

Read and discuss the Course Catalog with your parents.

3.

Consult with your counselor and Instructional Lead when questions arise.

4.

Discuss the preliminary course selections with your parents.

5.

Fill out the Time Management Worksheet and make adjustments to your selections, as needed, to maintain
a balanced life.

6.

Go to the Infinite Campus Portal and complete online course selection. You must select at least one alternate
course for all electives. If no alternate courses are chosen and another course selection needs to be made,
you will be placed in a course where there is availability.
• The Course Selection Portal is open for registration: January 25th, 2023
• The Course Selection Portal will close on: March 3rd, 2023

School’s Responsibility in Scheduling
1.

The school shall build a master schedule to support student selection and learning to the best of its ability.

GUNN HIGH SCHOOL COURSE CATALOG 2023-2024

2.

The school shall provide appropriate support in the course selection process.
a.

b.

c.
d.
3.

Eighth grade students will have course selection presentations at their respective middle schools,
a parent informational night, parent meetings for questions and brief follow-up student
meetings at the middle school to confirm schedule selections.
Grade 9 students will also create a Four-Year-Plan with their Counselor during the first quarter
of their 9th grade year. In the month of January, grade 9 students will have a group session with
their counselor through the SELF/Study Hall program to review and adjust their Four-YearPlan.
Grade 10 students will have a small group presentation about course selection for grade 11, in
addition to a review and adjustment of their Four-Year-Plan.
Grade 11 students will have an assembly and availability for appointments for 12th grade planning
and four-year planning support during PRIME sessions in January.

The school shall review and provide a course catalog to all students electronically to support their decision
making in course selection. Paper copies of the catalog may be available on request.

4. By the time the course registration window closes on March 3rd, 2023, a Course Selection
Verification document, Honors/AP Agreement and Time Management Worksheet should be
uploaded to their Counseling course in Schoology.

Dual Enrollment Courses vs Concurrent Enrollment
Dual Enrollment courses refer to high-school courses that have gone through curricular alignment with a community
college and whose students take classes on a PAUSD campus, therefore earning high school credits and college
credits simultaneously. Dual Enrollment courses are distinguished with a “D” at the end of the course number.
Students in dual enrollment courses will receive the normal high school credit. For example, if a “regular” high
school course earns five credits, the dual enrollment version of that course will earn five credits on the PAUSD
transcript. Please see additional information about dual enrollment page 89.
Grades, upon completion of the course, will be weighted similarly to AP or Honors classes in weighted GPA
calculations, as they are rigorous courses that have gone through an alignment process with the Community College.
Concurrent Enrollment courses are courses taken off campus at a Community College through prior approval.
Students who wish to place a Community College course on their transcript will receive double credit. However,
grades for Concurrent Enrollment courses are not weighted. Please note that some Community Colleges refer to
Concurrent Enrollment courses as Dual Enrollment.

Off-Campus Courses (non-PAUSD)
Courses required for graduation must be taken on campus. However, some courses, usually for elective credit or
to make up a “D” or an “F” earned in a previous course, may be taken off campus with prior approval. Transcript
credit will be granted only for approved courses taken at an accredited school. Prior Approval forms are available
online in the Counseling section of the Gunn website. For any course taken off campus, it is the responsibility of the
student to ensure that the course is taken through an accredited institution and that the course will be accepted by
colleges.
All courses taken off-campus require the prior approval of the student’s parent/guardian, the student’s
counselor, and Assistant Principal of Student Services through submission of the Off Campus Course Approval
form.

Students wishing to take Community College courses must first obtain the written permission of the Assistant
Principal of Student Services through the Off-Campus Course Approval form available on the Counseling page of
the Gunn website. Please be aware that community colleges may not allow students to take a course that is
also offered at the high school. Also, courses taken at the community college are college-level courses and the start
of a permanent college transcript that must be included when applying to other colleges.

6

GUNN HIGH SCHOOL COURSE CATALOG 2023-2024

No more than 40 credits of the 220 credits required for graduation from PAUSD may be taken at off-campus
institutions. Only 80 credits per year can be placed on a student’s transcript. Summer School credits will be applied
to the following school year.

More information can be found in the Counseling section of the Gunn website under “Off Campus Courses”.

Prioritize Graduation Requirements
Palo Alto Unified School District graduation requirements (including CTE and VPA) must be satisfied before students
are allowed to take two classes in the same discipline (e.g., two World Languages classes at the same time or two Science
classes at the same time). Any exception to this policy must be approved by the counselor and by the Assistant Principal
of Student Services.

Prior Recommended Course(s)
Prior recommended courses are STRONGLY suggested courses. Students who have completed prior
recommended courses have the necessary foundational skills to be successful in a course. Students should consult
with the teachers of the course of interest before attempting to take a course without having completed the prior
recommended courses.
Prerequisites are certain conditions that students must have successfully completed in order to take a course, by
prior approval from the teacher of the desired course.

Schedule Modifications
Gunn High School does not grant schedule changes unless the request meets one or more of the criteria listed below.
Any student wishing to request a schedule modification must do so by completing the Schedule Change Request
form available in the Counseling section of the Gunn website. Forms will be reviewed by the school counselors and
administration.
The criteria for a schedule change are as follows:
• Grade-level requirement missing from schedule (12th only)
• Course already taken (10th-12th)
• Prior Recommended/Prerequisite course not fulfilled (9th-12th)
• Schedule has an error (same class listed twice, class omitted, or class requested not included) (9th-12th)
• Courses on schedule that have previously been completed must be dropped (9th-12th)
• Any course that a student wishes to add to their schedule must be included as an “alternate” on their course
selection list.

NOTE: We cannot accommodate schedule requests or changes based on teacher preference, specific class period requests, or
learning style. We strongly believe that students benefit from learning from a variety of different teachers.

Level Changes
Level changes must be initiated by a conversation with the student’s current teacher. The student’s counselor will be
notified once the student submits the Gunn Schedule Change Request form , which can be found on the Gunn
Counseling webpage. Counselors will work with the departmental Instructional Lead to finalize the request.
**** Important Note - Beginning in the 2023-2024 School year: If you select any of the following courses, level
change requests will be considered ONLY at the end of the 1st Progress reporting period in September:
• Geo, Geo H
• Alg, Alg 2/Trig A, Alg 2/Trig H
• PreCalc, IAC, Analysis H
• Bio, Bio H
• Chem, Chem H
• AP Physics C (Mechanics (Sem 1) + Electricity & Magnetism (Sem 2) and yearlong, AP Physics 1
• AP BC Calculus, AP AB Calculus

7

GUNN HIGH SCHOOL COURSE CATALOG 2023-2024

English Department Course Level Change Policy: The English department is dedicated to providing the
best learning environment for all students. Courses with the same name do not necessarily cover the same standards
and texts simultaneously. Therefore, all English course level changes must take place by the end of the second week of
the semester.

Such changes are contingent on the Instructional Lead’s approval. The Instructional Lead will consider a student’s
current and past performance, class size, dynamic of the class, and the overall circumstances.
Social Studies Department Course Level Change Policy: With the exception AP US History, level changes must
take place by the end of the second week of the semester/year. Students who wish to drop AP Econ or AP
Psychology during the first semester must do so by the end of the second week of the semester in order to be placed in
Econ 11 or a non-AP Social Studies elective during the first semester. Anyone dropping after that date will be placed
in Econ 11 or a non-AP Social Studies elective at the start of second semester. Students wishing to move from AP US
History to US History must do so within the first 4 weeks of the first semester.
Math Department Course Level Change Policy: Students choose a particular level based on their performance in
the previous course, teacher recommendation, and potential summer work. Students earning a C- or below in a class
can request a level change during the year. Such changes are contingent on class size and must be approved by the
Instructional Lead of the department. Changes can only be made before the end of the first Progress Report or at the
semester break. Students who change levels during the semester will carry over their current homework grade to
their new course, but not their grade on assessments. A plan for reassessing on missed learning targets will be
arranged between teacher and student.
Science Department Course Level Change Policy: Level changes for first semester will be considered ONLY at the
end of the 1st Progress reporting period in the first semester or at the end of the first semester for the start of the
second semester. The impact on class sizes, the potential success of the student in the current course and the effect
on other courses in the student’s schedule will be considered. We do not guarantee the request will be honored. Level
changes must be approved by both teachers as well as the Instructional Lead. All efforts will be made to support
struggling students and to facilitate success (“C” or higher) in their science courses.

Students wishing to challenge themselves in a higher-level course may choose that course during Course Selection.
Teachers recommend that students stay in a course until after the first Progress Report in order to have multiple
types of assessments (quiz, test, lab report, homework) to help inform their desire to change levels. However, such
changes are contingent on class size and must be approved by the Instructional Lead of the department.
Students interested in changing levels should contact their science teachers as soon as possible in order to discuss their
options. Students who change levels during the semester will carry over their current grade to their new course.
English language learners are correctly placed in a class if they demonstrate enough knowledge of English to earn a
“C” grade or better. At any time, if they are not able to perform at that level due to their English language proficiency,
the counselor together with the EL coordinator will support the student’s level change, or dropping of the course.
(California State Board of Education Policy #98-04) (California State Board of Education Policy #98-04)

Dropping a Course
Students wishing to drop a course in which they are enrolled should discuss dropping that course with their teacher. They
must then submit a Schedule Change Request Form to their counselor. Schedule Change Request forms can be found
in the Counseling section on the Gunn website. Students must attend the class until their schedule is officially changed.
Colleges should be notified of any changes in academic schedule if completed after the application has been sent. It is
the student’s responsibility to make this notification.
A student wishing to drop a course in which they are enrolled and not have it appear on their transcript must do so
by the date indicated on the Calendar of Events posted on the Gunn website.

Grading
A student wishing to drop a course in which they are enrolled and not have it appear on their transcript must do so
by the date indicated on the Calendar of Events posted on the Gunn website.

GUNN HIGH SCHOOL COURSE CATALOG 2023-2024

The Use of Plus or Minus as Part of the Letter Mark
The mark of record may carry a plus (+) or minus (-) attached to the letter grade of A, B, C, or D. The pluses and
minuses will appear on both the report cards and transcripts. The Grade Point Average does not include the pluses or
minuses in the calculation.
Conditions Controlling Use of “I”, “P”, “NM” , and “NC”
• Mark of “I”: A mark of “I” (INCOMPLETE) may be given when for some unusual reason (illness) a student has
been unable to complete required course work. The student must enter a contract with the teacher to complete
the work. If the contract has not been fulfilled and the “I” has not been changed to a different mark by the end of
the next grading period in which the student received an incomplete, the “I” will be converted to a mark of “F”
by the Registrar. A mark of “I” may not be given as a final mark at the close of the school year.
• Mark of “P” (PASS-CREDIT): A mark of “P” may be given only for non a-g courses or in special circumstances.
A mark of “P” is not used for calculation of the GPA.
• Mark of “NM” (NO MARK): A mark of “NM” may be given when it is inappropriate to make an evaluation.
Credit will not be given and “NM” will not impact GPA.
• Mark of “NC” (NO CREDIT): A mark of “NC” may be given in lieu of “F” and indicates that student work is
not up to standard. “NC” will not impact GPA.

Eligibility for a Mark
A new student who enrolls in a given course at least four weeks prior to the close of a grade-reporting period (semester)
is entitled to a mark (including NM and NC). A student who has withdrawn from the district, school or course during
the four weeks prior to the end of a grade reporting period is entitled to a valid mark (including NM and NC) even
though the student is no longer enrolled.
Maximum Graduation Credits Earnable
A student may not earn more than a maximum of 80 credits toward graduation in any given school year. This includes
summer school and any courses taken off campus. Courses taken off campus during the summer are applied towards
the following school year (please see above guidance for courses taken off-campus).
Repeated Course
When an academic course is repeated because a student intends to improve the mark of record, the credit shall be
attached to the better mark; both marks shall remain on the transcript. The higher mark is used in the computation of
the GPA. Students are not allowed to repeat a course in which they earned a C- or above. Repeated courses are applied
to the school year in which the course was originally attempted.

HONORS /ADVANCED PLACEMENT
AGREEMENT

Gunn High School supports any student who wishes to enroll in Honors and/or Advanced Placement (AP) classes.
However, the majority of Honors/AP classes are reserved for 11&12th graders. Honors and AP classes are NOT
weighted for 9th grade students. AP Computer Science Principles is the only approved AP class for 9th graders. Please
remember that Advanced Placement courses are college level courses. Students should be motivated to take an
Honors/AP class by an appreciation for the subject. Students who are overextended with academics and/or
extracurricular activities should give careful consideration to whether they have time to devote to an Honors/ AP class
and also to the number of Honors/AP classes that they can successfully complete. Gunn High School suggests a
maximum of two AP classes per semester.
Students who enroll in an AP course are expected to:

1.
2.
3.
4.
5.

Be independent learners willing to read, learn, ask questions, pursue outside reading and research, integrate
and discuss material from diverse sources.
Meet any prerequisites prior to enrolling in an AP course.
Prepare for and take tests on time.
Accept that enrollment in an AP course does not guarantee an A or B grade.
Spend more than the average amount of time on work outside of class.

Students who enroll in an Honors/AP course must h a v e their parent/guardian sign t he following agreement. By
signing the agreement, you commit to the following:

1.

2.

3.
4.
5.
6.
7.

8.

I recognize that I have to demonstrate independence and responsibility. Honors/AP courses typically
require more homework compared to college prep courses (approximately 40 minutes a night or 2.5 hours a
week).
I commit to remain enrolled in the Honors/AP courses I have chosen for the entire duration of the course. If
special circumstances arise and I must drop an Honors/AP course, I understand there may not be space
available in a college prep class. I understand I may have to delay taking a required class because of my
drop.
I understand that Gunn High School does not recommend students take more than two AP classes per year.
I understand there may be a prerequisite for an Honors /AP course as outlined in the Gunn course catalog.
By enrolling in an Honors/AP course, I certify that I meet these prerequisites.
I agree to uphold Gunn High School’s Academic Integrity Policy.
I will speak with my parent/guardian, teacher or guidance counselor if I start feeling overwhelmed with my
academic workload.
I realize that by enrolling in an AP course I am expected to take the corresponding Advanced Placement

ENGLISH
The English program at Gunn High School focuses on the traditional concerns of the discipline—literature,
composition, language, and grammar. Literature serves as a resource for the study of ideas, culture, and values, as
well as the development of composition skills. The study of composition and writing emphasizes the art and the
craft, the organization and the support, and the clear and effective use of language in its written forms. Vocabulary,
language, and grammar studies are integrated with the study of literature and composition.
The Gunn English program consists of a four-year required sequence of both required and elective semester-long
courses designed to meet students’ needs in literature, composition, and language study. The complete sequence
includes required courses in American, World, Contemporary, and Western Literatures, as well as in
communication skills and literary genres.
In 2023-2024, students in grades 9 and 10 should enroll in the corresponding College Preparatory or Accelerated
English course. The choices are English 9 (College Prep) or English 9A (Accelerated) and English 10 (College Prep)
or English 10A (Accelerated). The choice of college prep or accelerated/advanced should be made with consideration
of prior performance in English classes, work habits, development of skills, and academic interests. Consultation
with a student’s current English teacher and counselor may be helpful in making a choice.

English Course Progression

*GRADE 12 ONLY: Students may take the yearlong AP English Literature & Composition (Course# 1279) instead
of 2 semester long English courses. Taking AP English indicates a commitment to taking the AP Examination in
Literature and Composition in May.
In 2023-2024, students in grades 11 and 12 will select one required semester of either World Literature (College
Prep) or World Classics H, a course that carries an “honors” designation on the transcript. In addition, students in
grades 11 and 12 should indicate on their Course Request forms a choice of one semester-long elective and two
alternate elective selections. It is very important to make accurate and thoughtful selections on this form so that the
department schedule accurately reflects students’ choices; requests made later are often difficult or impossible to
satisfy, and courses with insufficient initial enrollment, may not be offered through the department. Students in grade
12 may also choose to take the yearlong AP English Literature & Composition course instead of two semester long
English courses.

HOMEWORK EXPECTATIONS FOR
ENGLISH COURSES
By the nature of the discipline, the study of English will take some learners longer than others. In addition, due to the
cycles of long- and short-term projects, a statement of the amount of time required for homework is only an estimation
and an average. Homework for English generally comprises reading, writing, and the study of vocabulary. Advanced
and honors courses, including AP English Literature and Composition, may require an average of three to five hours
per week of work outside of class; regular and elective courses usually require less time. Included in many descriptions
is the average time spent as surveyed by last year’s classes.

ENGLISH LANGUAGE
LEARNERS (ELL)
The English Language Learners (ELL) program offers individual and group instruction to meet the needs of students
whose primary language is not English and have limited English proficiency. We prepare students for College Prep
classes by providing an extensive program of English instruction on different levels (emerging, expanding, and
bridging English language proficiency). For the students with emerging English proficiency, we offer individual
tutoring in a student’s primary language to ensure access to the core curriculum.
In addition, we offer ELL Social Studies courses which are taught by teachers in the Social Studies Department and are
open to ELL students. The University of California grants admission credit “a” for all of the ELL social studies courses
and credit “b” for one year of ELL (English EL28) and one year of Intermediate Composition.
Because our English Learner students contribute a welcoming diversity to our campus, we encourage them to
participate in school activities and clubs, so they can experience the social life of an American high school. This not
only promotes cross-cultural understanding, but also helps young people maintain a positive self-concept.
If English Learner students are at the emerging or expanding levels in English proficiency (that is, if they do not speak,
read, and write in fluent English), and if they plan to earn a diploma of graduation, we urge them to enroll in the ELL
program at Gunn High School.

MATHEMATICS
Mathematics is offered in three college preparatory sequences. Students who are new to PAUSD are recommended
for a math course based on the results of a placement test.
Our college prep pathway is a four-year sequence that prepares students for their first calculus course in college. It
begins with Algebra 1 and also includes Geometry, Algebra2 and Pre-Calculus. It is possible, by doing summer work,
to begin in this pathway and still finish with AB Calculus. Please contact the math IL to discuss such a pathway. Our
new Introduction to Data Science course will offer an alternative to Pre-Calculus.
Students who have completed Algebra in middle school should enroll in Geometry or Geometry Honors.
The advanced pathway takes students through Advanced Placement AB Calculus, and prepares them to finish “C
Calculus” in college. This course sequence includes Geometry A, Algebra2/TrigA, Intro to Analysis and Calculus, and
Advanced Placement AB Calculus.
The most rigorous course of study is a four-year honors sequence that culminates with the Advanced Placement course
BC Calculus. This course sequence includes Geometry H, Algebra2/TrigH, Analysis Honors, and Advanced Placement
BC Calculus.
It is possible for students to change between levels over the course of their math education. Your student’s counselor,
math teacher, and the Math Instructional Lead (IL) can help with such decisions. Students showing academic
responsibility, independence, and mastery on current year assessments might consider moving up a level. Students not
meeting these requirements are encouraged to speak with the IL for support choosing a new level. Changing levels
may require summer work.
Elective courses include Advanced Placement Statistics (full year) and Applied Math H (semester). Other elective
courses which may receive math credit, such as Computer Science and BEAM, can be viewed in the CTE section of
the course catalog.

SCIENCE

To graduate from high school, students are required to have one year of physical science and one year of life science,
both of which fulfill the University of California (UC) laboratory science requirement (known as UC ‘d’). Since the
University of California recommends three years of lab science, students are strongly encouraged to take yearlong
courses in the core sciences – biology, chemistry, and physics. All Gunn science course offerings are college-prep
courses and fulfill the UC “d” requirement.
While we encourage students to take on healthy challenges in their science course selection, strict policies regarding
adding or dropping courses once the semester has begun are enforced. (See page 7 for level change information.) For
this reason, students should carefully consider their course choices. To assist with this process, in each course
description, the Science Department has listed course prerequisites, predictors of success, and homework time
commitment expectations.

environment. The goal of Conceptual Physics is to develop a conceptual understanding of the fundamental principles of
physics through compulsory laboratory explorations and investigations. In this college-prep course, students will learn to
model their thinking to problem-solve situations and to explain physical phenomena in their daily lives using evidence and
reasoning. The content of the course is drawn from the NGSS Physics of the Universe curriculum. Use of simple
mathematical formulas for analysis will support the development of algebraic skills and provide reinforcement for material
covered in introductory algebra courses.

PAINTING & DRAWING
Grades 10-12

Year

# 6340

UC Approved “f”

Drawing is the foundation for artists to develop their ideas, regardless of the medium of the final product. This
course will prepare any student to draw well by enhancing their ability to see subtle value ranges, create a full range of
bold values, understand relationships of space and learn what makes a strong composition.
Designed as the first course in the Drawing and Painting Program, the curriculum gradually builds upon itself to move
from an exploration in expressive mark-making with graphite, conté, charcoal, colored pencil and pastel, to a painting
experience. Drawing well is the foundation for painting well, thus it is after learning technical drawing that advanced
color theory, painting approaches and brush techniques are considered through acrylic, watercolor and digital
painting.
Assignments are designed to build the “artist’s tool belt”– the technical and expressive skills to render a broad range
of surface qualities or textures upon the illusion of forms, in both black and white and color. The lessons encourage
creative, imaginative thinking to begin visually communicating personal concepts.
Historical and cross-cultural views on art are integrated into lessons and discussions; sketchbooks are highly used; and
exposure to local artwork is obligatory. Representatives will be invited to present, from private Art Colleges and UCs
with strong art programs, about options for art careers.
Course work will include art history, research, museum reports, artist statements, and participation in critiques.

AVID is a UC-approved elective class for students who are college-bound, but could use a bit more support. The AVID
curriculum focuses on writing, inquiry, collaboration, organization, and reading (WICOR), all with the goal of getting
students college ready. Tutorials, note-taking, study strategies, time management, standardized test prep, and goal setting
are key components of the course.
In ninth grade, a major focus is the transition to high school and keeping up with the workload. Tenth grade focuses on
beginning to explore potential career paths and expanding future college resumes. Eleventh grade starts to hone in on
potential college fits and standardized test prep. By senior year, the focus shifts to the college application process and the
transition out of high school.
Interested students should sign up for the course, and they will be interviewed to see if they are a good fit for the program.
Alternatively, current AVID students may be recommended by their AVID teacher.

SOCIAL JUSTICE PATHWAY COURSES
What: The Social Justice Pathway is a three-year program featuring self-direction and project-based learning in an
interdisciplinary model rooted in community action and collaboration. Students begin by learning the practices of
social justice in sophomore year by identifying global and local issues that they want to devote themselves to, and learn
how to achieve transformative rather than temporary relief from social problems. This program encourages students
of all backgrounds to appreciate the richness of their similarities and differences; to understand the beliefs, conditions
and policies that have marginalized and oppressed populations; to listen with empathy; to foster in all their peers a
sense of belonging to a community; and to resolve conflict peacefully; all in the name of Freedom, Justice and Equality.
Who: This program is for students interested in empowerment, conviction and the passion to build a better world
and are willing to work hard at it. It is also a program that encourages diverse viewpoints. It provides an opportunity
for authentic education and experiential learning beyond the high school walls. The Social Justice Pathway is for the
student who is interested in rigorous curriculum that is not learned in a traditional way.
How: Designed to be a school-within-a-school, this three-year program begins sophomore year. Gunn's social justice
program will give committed students the opportunity to study the principles of justice, freedom and equality that
form our nation's core values, as well as the worldwide history of oppression and injustice towards marginalized
populations, within the context of the core college-preparatory and A-G approved curriculum. Students move together
through Social Studies and AAR classes, working in a project-based environment both on and off campus. Class work
is designed to connect to real issues identified by our students and challenges in our local community. Then, students
make their own solutions to these problems and work to solve them. Social Justice Pathway is available for 10th, 11th
and 12th grade students.

DUAL ENROLLMENT COURSES
Dual Enrollment courses refer to high-school courses that have gone through curricular alignment with a community
college and whose students are enrolled in two institutions concurrently, therefore earning high school credits and
college credits simultaneously.
Students in dual enrollment courses will receive regular credit per course. For example, if a “regular” high school
course earns five credits, the dual enrollment version of that course will earn five credits on the PAUSD transcript.
Grades, upon completion of the course, will be weighted similarly to AP or Honors classes in weighted GPA
calculations, as they are rigorous courses that have gone through an alignment process with the community college.
This also means that, if students decide to drop the class, they will need to consider the deadlines and consequences
for doing so at each institution.

AP Seminar, an interdisciplinary offering from the College Board, is the first of two courses in the AP Capstone
program. The course offers the foundational research and writing skills students will need for college-level and
professional work. The course focuses on the process-oriented skill sets rather than on content specific to a particular
discipline. Students will synthesize and articulate research on any number of subjects into formally presented
arguments, both written, multi-media, and oral. There is also a large collaborative component of the course, as students
work in teams to present their findings. Similar to a "First-Year" seminar experience in college, students will engage in
cross-curricular conversations that explore the complexities of academic and real-world topics and issues by analyzing
divergent perspectives (scientific, economic, political, cultural). Students should be strong readers of non-fiction
primary texts, fluent writers and team players.
• Homework Expectation: 3 to 4 hours per week

APPENDIX

TIME MANAGEMENT
The number of hours you spend on certain tasks can be surprising, especially when you begin to compare the totals.
Do you spend almost as much time doing extracurricular activities as you do academics? Do you sleep—at all? Are
most of your meals eaten on the run? Do you wish you had more free time? As you begin to evaluate your current time
expenditures, consider some of the points below.

Academics
When planning your academic time ask yourself...
• How are you doing academically? Are you happy with your progress or do you feel you need to put more time
into your work? Do you need more time for studying, assignments or both?
• Which subjects are more challenging for you and require more of your time? Would it be helpful to seek help
in the AC and/or Library?
• Are you able to complete assignments on time? Do you have to stay up very late the night before an assignment
is due to finish?
• How often do you find yourself procrastinating on assignments? Do you need to work on using the academic
time you have more effectively?
• Do you currently use weekend time to study and do assignments?
• Do you sometimes feel overwhelmed by the amount of work you have to do?
• Do you usually study more than 2 days in advance of an exam? Are you able to prepare adequately for tests?

Extracurricular Activities
Finding the right balance between academics and extracurricular activities can be difficult. A commitment made to an
activity at the start of the year might not be easy to continue if classes become consuming.
When planning your extracurricular time ask yourself...
• Which of your extracurricular activities is most important to you? Why?
• Which of these activities help you to relax? Which help you to relieve or work off stress?
• Does your enthusiasm sometimes lead you to overcommitting to activities, clubs, sports, etc.?
• Have your extracurricular commitments ever adversely affected your academics? Are they adversely affecting
your academics now?
• Which do you enjoy more: well-structured activities with meeting times and established goals or independent
activities that you pursue at your own pace?
• Which of your extracurricular activities could you pursue in other ways? Are there more flexible ways to
participate in the same activity?

Sleep
Students love to sleep; yet it is the first thing they give up when pressed for time. Not only is sleep necessary for your
physical and mental well-being, you will simply not be able to concentrate well if you are tired, distracted and mentally
run down. You will spend more time on assignments, learn appreciably less and be vulnerable to making obvious
mistakes on exams and projects. Although it might feel as though you are doing more by sleeping less, the habit isn’t
sustainable, so sleep well and often, and consider it an investment.

92

GUNN HIGH SCHOOL COURSE CATALOG 2023-2024

When planning for sleep time ask yourself...
• How many hours of sleep per night are ideal for you? How many hours of sleep do you need to wake up feeling
rested and refreshed, but not groggy?
• Between which hours of the day are you most comfortable sleeping?
• Do you feel that you get enough sleep now?
• When you run short of time on assignments, do you sacrifice sleep to make up the balance?
• Do you often feel tired or lethargic in class, especially in the morning?
• Do you sometimes have difficulty concentrating in class and/or have headaches due to fatigue?
• Do you occasionally fall asleep in class?
• Do you often wish for (or take) a nap during the day?
• Are you able to get out of bed when the alarm clock rings the first time?

Meals
Eating is just as important as sleeping for all the same reasons. Always eat something in the morning, even if it is just
a breakfast bar on the way to class. Plan to make sit-down time for lunch and dinner—not only because you need the
fuel, but because you need physical, mental and emotional breaks in your day. Meals can rejuvenate you on all of these
levels. Relax, eat well and enjoy yourself.
When planning for meal time ask yourself...
• Do you make a point of eating regularly and well? Although you can’t always have a healthy, well-balanced
meal, do you usually try to make health-conscious decisions?
• Do you occasionally skip meals? How do you feel when you do?
• Does being hungry sometimes distract you in class?

Free Time!
At last! Are you surprised at the amount of free time that you have? Is it too much or too little? Do you prefer your
days to be more flexible and spontaneous or packed and busy? The amount of free time that you have at the start of
the year might diminish as you find fun things to do and your academics gain momentum. Again, a conservative
approach is often best: leave yourself some space to unwind and relax every day, and extra time to handle the
unexpected – whether it is a difficult assignment or going out with friends.
When planning for free time ask yourself...
• Which of your free time activities are most important to you? Which could you give up if you wanted or
needed to spend time on other things?
• Which of these activities help you to relax? Which help you to relieve or work off stress?
• Do you occasionally find yourself procrastinating by overindulging in one of these activities? Do you need to
be more disciplined about limiting these activities?
• Is there something that you would really like to do or try, but you never seem to have the time? Could you fit
it in by reprioritizing your other tasks?
